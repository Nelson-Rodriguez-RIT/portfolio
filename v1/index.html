        <h1>Introduction</h2>
        <hr id="seperation-line">
        <p>
            <b>Welcome!</b>
            <br><br>
            My name is Nelson Rodriguez and I'm currently a second-year Game Design and Development student at the
            <b><a href="https://www.rit.edu/computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences</a></b>. When it comes down to it, my passion is software programming, especially in the context of
            games and interactive media. I truly enjoy learning about the foundational systems (i.e. physics engine, 
            graphical pipelines, gameplay systems) behind many of the awesome games that I play and make. 
            <br><br>
            This website will serve as a place to both show off my cool projects and to easily access their repositories.
        </p>


        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <hr id="seperation-line">
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Nelson-Rodriguez-RIT/minecraft_prototype" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Minecraft Demo</span><br><img src="images/minecraft_prototype.png" alt="A 16x16 Minecraft environment with a few blocks and structures to demostrate capabilities"><br>
                <p>
                    A functional demo of “Minecraft” using C++ and OpenGL.
                    <br><br>
                    Includes multiple core Minecraft features such as physics, 
                    breaking/place blocks, targeted block highlighting, a simple GUI, and hotbar functionality. 
                    <br><br> 
                    This was a personal project, done with the intent of learning both the fundamentals of both C++ and OpenGL via practical application. 
                    The result was an increased understanding of C++ and a solid introduction to OpenGL, as well as the fundamentals of the graphic pipeline, shader programming, and GPU functionality.
                </p>
            </a></li>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/Nelson-Rodriguez-RIT/console_snake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Console Snake</span><br><img src="images/console_snake.png" alt="Classic snake game in the Window's console"><br>
                <p>
                    A real-time, interactive console application featuring the classic game of Snake.
                    <br><br>
                    Integrates real-time functionality through the use of manual delta-time calculations and the Window's API for input handling.
                    <br><br>
                    This was a personal project, with the sole intent of serving as an introduction to programming in C++.
                </p>
            </a></li>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/Nelson-Rodriguez-RIT/gdaps2_2235_team_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Moonwalk</span><br><img src="images/moonwalk.png" alt="Pixel platformer, showcasing some of the level terrain"><br>
                <p>
                    An action platformer where the player uses a companion robot to navigate otherwise unreachable terrain, while also attempting to defend themselves from the remnants 
                    of the previous security force roaming a desolate laboratory. Programmed in Monogame with C#.
                    <br><br>
                    This was a class group project, focused on developing a video game while simulating a more professional environment. This included both documentation and demonstrations, therefore
                    requiring not only practical skills but also communication and group problem-solving. 
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, third-party applications were both used and developed to aid the overall process.
