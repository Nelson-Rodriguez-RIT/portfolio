            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Nelson Rodriguez and I'm currently a second-year Game Design and Development student 
                at the Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences.
                <br><br> 
                When it comes down to it, my passion is software programming, especially in the context of games and 
                interactive media. I truly enjoy learning about the foundational systems (i.e. physics engine, 
                graphical pipelines, gameplay systems) behind many of the awesome games that I play and make. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What can I do?</h3>
            <p>
                My primary skillset revolves around programming, however, I do have expierence using asset creation 
                tools (Maya, Shotcut, Paint.Net, and Aseprite). 
                <br><br>
                While taught both C# and HTML/CSS/JavaScript from 
                college classes, I have gone out and expiremented with C++, OpenGL (and some of the shader programming that comes with it), Lua, and Love2D. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What will you find here?</h3>
            <p>
                On this site you'll find all of my notable projects and links to their repositories (to view one, click on 
                the title of the project). Each project has specific tags to help you quickly identify core details about 
                the project. Additionally, if there are any projects made with JavaScript or WebGL (Unity), there will be 
                seperate pages where you can view and play them!
                <br><br>
                You can find my contact information at the bottom of this page. Click "Contact" in the navigation bar to 
                instantly jump to it!
